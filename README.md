I will develop an app for kids that i will call "kiddy app".
Plan is to develop it using native (java) 
The app will be a guide to parents,guardians informing them about events or activities that children attended showing details of place,location and calendar to show the date, time and the weather.
It will also have functions such as 'search','add','delete'`,'update'
