I will develop an app for kids that i will call "kiddy app".
Plan is to develop it using native (java) or hybrid (phonegap)
The app will be a guide to parents,guardians informing them about events taking place for kids,calendar to show the date and time,the weather.
It will also have functions such as 'search','add','delete'`,'save'
